We have look through the datasets, and got an idea that the variable 'season' would also influence the result. But the origin data is string, so we first transform the 'season' into numbers. (spring->1, summer->2, autumn->3, winter->4) After that, we used the multiple imputation by chained equations with random forests to fill the NaN data. With completed datasets, we used the random forest regression to form the model. With trained model and test dataset, we got our result.
